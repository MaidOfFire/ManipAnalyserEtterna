## How it Works:
The number **Manip Factor** (or MF) gets bigger the more a player hits one-hand misaligned notes (like trills or streams), as if they were a single aligned pattern (like jumps). The assumption is that when a player abuses this kind of playstyle, the hit errors (offsets) for consecutive different columns notes will be negatively correlatedâ€”meaning if one note is hit late, the next one tends to be hit early, making the difference between the errors larger than if the notes were hit as expected.

To measure the degree of such abuse from the replay data, we collect pairs of all misaligned one-hand notes and calculate the difference between their error values: |error_B - error_A|. Then we normalize this by using half the average time interval between notes on a single column and average the number across all pairs. The bigger the final number gets the more the player's technique leans toward manip play.
